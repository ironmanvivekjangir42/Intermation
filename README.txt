This is a project to generate interactive environments using Natural Language Processing.
This uses speech recognition to convert speech into text. It then uses named entity recognition, dependency tree, and parts of speech tagging to extract information about the secene. This information is then used to generate a interactive environmant in 3D inside processing.
